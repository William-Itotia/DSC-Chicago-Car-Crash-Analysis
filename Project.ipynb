    "Road accidents are a common occurrence in our daily lives, and it is likely that you or someone you know has been involved in one, hopefully without severe consequences. The ultimate goal is to reduce the number of road accidents. We will work with the Chicago Car Crash dataset to identify trends and predict the major causes of road accidents. By analyzing this data, we aim to develop strategies to reduce the frequency and severity of road accidents.\n",
